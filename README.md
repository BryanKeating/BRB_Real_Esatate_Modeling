# BRB_Reality_Modeling
## Overview
For this project, we were tasked to address the following prompt
    

    
## Business Understanding
At BRB reality, our job is to find solutions to your Real Estate Goals.  We created mamathematical models which predict Real Estate data, allowing us to give you calculated recommendations with calculated risk. 


## Data Understanding and Analysis
For this project, we utilized the following sources of data:
    1 . KCSO Offense Reports 2020-Present 
        This data set gave us criminal offenses based on each Zip Code. We created a rating sytem and rated them from 0-5 based on the number of crimes in          each Zip Code. The higher our saftey rating-the lower the crime.  (55,000 Crimes)
    2. KC_Hosusing_Data
        This data set gave us various factors in predicting the price of a house. From this data, we used price, square foot living, number of bedrooms,            and the age of each house. We nemoved the outlier house that contained 33 bedroom inorder to better visualize our data. (21,500 homes)
    3. WA State School District Rankings 2020
        This data set gives us School District Ranking tied to each house's zip code. We used this data set to group each house into School Districts by            zip code and then compared our results to the school districts rating. (250 School Rankings)

Final Data Set-20,632

## Modeling
1. Linear Regression Model




2. School District Rating vs. Price

3. Square Foot Living vs. Price

4. Saftey Rating vs. Price

5. Age of Home vs. Price





Limitations:Saftey Rating. We would like more data that tell us what type of crime happend.
No linear Data
